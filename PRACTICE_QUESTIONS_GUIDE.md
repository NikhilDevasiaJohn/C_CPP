# Practice Questions Guide

## How to Use Practice Questions

Each tutorial module now includes a **📝 Practice Questions** section with blank spaces for you to fill in as you learn. This active learning approach helps reinforce concepts.

## Learning Strategy

### 1. **Read First**
- Read through the tutorial section
- Understand the concepts and examples
- Run the code examples yourself

### 2. **Answer Questions**
- Try to answer each question from memory
- Fill in the blanks in the tutorial file
- Don't look at the answers immediately

### 3. **Verify**
- Check your answers against the tutorial content
- If wrong, re-read that section
- Update your answer

### 4. **Review Regularly**
- Come back to questions after a few days
- Test your retention
- Identify weak areas

## Tips for Success

### ✅ Do's
- **Write answers by hand first** - Better retention
- **Use your own words** - Don't copy from tutorial
- **Be specific** - Detailed answers show understanding
- **Review weekly** - Spaced repetition works
- **Test yourself** - Cover answers and try again

### ❌ Don'ts
- **Don't skip questions** - Each one is important
- **Don't just copy** - Understanding > memorization
- **Don't rush** - Take time to think
- **Don't ignore wrong answers** - Learn from mistakes

## Example: How to Fill Questions

### Before Learning:
```
**Q:** What is a pointer?  
**A:** _________________________________
```

### After Learning (Good Answer):
```
**Q:** What is a pointer?  
**A:** A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
     Declared with *, accessed with & (address-of) and * (dereference).
```

### After Learning (Better Answer):
```
**Q:** What is a pointer?  
**A:** A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
     - Declared: int *ptr;
     - Get address: ptr = &x;
     - Access value: *ptr
     - Critical for dynamic memory and CUDA GPU memory management
```
